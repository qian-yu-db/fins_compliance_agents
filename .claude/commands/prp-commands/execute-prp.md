- Integration tests for multi-agent workflows
- Performance tests for scalability
- Security tests for compliance

**Validation Gates:**
- Code quality checks
- Configuration validation
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarking

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
- Deployment success rate > 99%
- Agent response time < 2 seconds
- Financial calculation accuracy > 99.5%
